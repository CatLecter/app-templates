# Testing Frameworks

### Here are the examples of using web frameworks that are closest to real tasks.

1. [BlackSheep](https://github.com/Neoteroi/BlackSheep) is an asynchronous web framework to build event based web applications with Python.
2. [Litestar](https://github.com/litestar-org/litestar) is a powerful, performant, flexible and opinionated ASGI framework, offering first class typing support and a full Pydantic integration.
3. [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
